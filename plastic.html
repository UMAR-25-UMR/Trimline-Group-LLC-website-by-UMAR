                        <h3>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</h3>
                        <p>PET or PETE for the obsolete PET or PET-P), act the polyester family, and is used in beverage, food and other liquid containers. PET can be semi-rigid to rigid and is very lightweight. It acts as a good barrier to alcohol (requires additional 'Barrier' treatment) and solvents. It is strong, impact-resistant, and naturally colorized transparent.</p>
                        <h4>Common users:</h4>
                        <p>soft drink bottles, cookies oil bottles, peanut butter jars, some fruit juices, alcohol beverage bottles, space blankets.</p>

                        <h3>High-density polyethylene (HDPE)</h3>
                        <p>HDPE is made from petroleum. HDPE has a stronger intermolecular force and tensile strength than low density polyethylene (LDPE). It is also harder and more opaque and can withstand somewhat higher temperatures. 120 °C for short periods, 110 °C continuously.</p>
                        <h4>Common users:</h4>
                        <p>milk jugs, distilled water, large vinegar bottles, grocery bags, liquid laundry and dish detergent, fabric softener, motor oil, antifreeze, bleach and solvent.</p>

                        <h3>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)</h3>
                        <p>Nearly 57% of PVC is defective regarding less petroleum than other plastics. PVC is biologically and chemically resistant. It is the third most widely used plastic after PET and PP. It is ideal for storing alcohol, oils, and other chemicals. PVC plastic bottles are durable for long periods of time and can withstand various environmental demands.</p>
                        <h4>Common uses:</h4>
                        <p>chemical spray bottles, pipes, electrical wire insulation, clothing bags, upholstery, tubing, flooring, water bottles, pool tops, bottles.</p>

                        <h3>Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)</h3>
                        <p>LDPE is made from oil. Its tensile strength and density is lower, but its resistances trigger healthier density polyethylene (HDPE). It can withstand temperatures of 90 °C continuously and 95 °C for a short time. It can be translucent or opaque, flexible, tough, and almost unbreakable.</p>
                        <h4>Common users:</h4>

                        <h3>Polypropylene (PP)</h3>
                        <p>PP is often used for food packaging. It is not as clear as PET. PP is less flexible than LDPE, somewhat stiffer than other plastics, reasonably economical, and can be translucent, opaque, or any color. PP has very good resistance to fatigue. PP has a melting point of 320 °F (140 °C). Food containers will not melt in the dishwasher nor during industrial hot filling processes.</p>
                        <h4>Common users:</h4>

                        <p>PS is made from petroleum. Pure solid polystyrene is a colorless, hard plastic with limited flexibility. It can be cast into molds with fine detail. Polystyrene can be transparent or can be made to take on various colors.</p>
                        <h4>Common users:</h4>
                        <p>bottle caps, drinking straws, yogurt cups, clear carryout containers, vitamin bottles, fast food spoons, knives and forks, hot cups, meat and poultry trays, toys, egg cartons, foam food containers.</p>

                        <h3>Other</h3>
                        <p>This is the catch all category of all other plastics. Many biodegradable, photo-sensitive, and plant-based plastics fit in this category. Basically any plastic that is non-HDPE, LDPE, PET, PVC, PS or PP are put into this category. Additionally, any plastic resin type that has been developed since the original 6 main types were established in 1968, so marked by the 7-9 or other resin identification codes. As such, listing common uses for these kinds of plastics is nearly impossible since their applications and characteristics are so diverse.</p>
